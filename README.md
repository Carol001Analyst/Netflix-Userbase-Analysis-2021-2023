Introduction

Here’s a deep dive into the Netflix userbase between 2021-2023. This article highlights the methodology, observations, and recommendations to boost subscriptions in the Netflix application. 

Methodology/Tools Used:

You can access this data at https://www.kaggle.com/code/theelahi/netflix-userbase-eda/input.

2.    The Power Query tool of the Power BI app was useful in data cleaning such as elimination of duplicate variables.

3.    Microsoft Power BI was the primary tool used to create the visualization charts and dashboard in general. Visualization helps provide a thorough exploration of user trends and patterns across multiple dimensions of the dataset.

4.    MS Excel was helpful in comparing the dataset consistency and accurate output trough tools like the Pivot Tables.

 

Main Observations

1.     From a quick glance, there was a total of 2,500 subscribers based on count of user IDs in the dataset.

2.     2022 was the year with the most users of the Netflix movie app, with 2.4K subscribers and the rest distributed between 2021 and 2023.

3.     The sum of revenue in this case study was $31,000.

4.     Basic subscription plan was the most popular among users, followed by Standard then Premium plans.

5.     Majority of subscribers in these regions opted to use laptops, then tablets, followed by smartphones, and lastly smart TVs.

6.     The top three regions in terms of subscriptions were Spain, USA, and Canada­­. UK had the least subscriptions.

7.     Most subscribers are between 41-50 years, followed by 31-40, 21-30, and lastly those members above 51 years of age.

8.     Percentage of female and male users were almost same though females were slightly higher at 50.28% and 49.72% for the males.

 

Recommendations

1.     Do an analysis on the genre of movies and TV shows that sell the most and focus on having more of such in the app. This will help maintain interest of watchers, thereby retaining and also increasing subscriptions. More subscriptions mean higher revenues.

2.     Work with popular local actors to promote the app in their respective regions. This could be through their social platforms and also on mainstream media channels. This will interest their fans to try out the app, since they can relate to their celebrity icon and can trust the brands they vouch for.

3.     Focus marketing efforts on the 2021 and 2023 movie contents. Target these years with tailored campaigns that address specific interests. For instance, to boost engagement, Netflix could bundle up movies in these years that didn’t sell as much, then offer incentives like discount offers for such bundled plans.

4.     Given that many users opt for the Basic plan, there is a significant opportunity to up-sell users to Standard or Premium plans. Netflix could offer free trials, bundles, or time-limited discounts to encourage users to try higher-tier plans. Highlight the additional benefits of Standard and Premium plans (e.g., HD, multiple screens) in targeted marketing efforts, especially in regions with high user concentrations like the USA, Canada, and Spain.

5.     Additionally, customizing content for top regions can help engage more subscribers. Netflix could invest more in local content (regional language shows or exclusive releases) for Spain, the USA, and Canada. In the low-performing regions like the UK, Netflix could ramp up localized content strategies and promotions, offering discounts or content relevant to British tastes. Additionally, consider conducting surveys in low-engagement regions to understand preferences and improve targeted offerings.

6.     Since laptops dominate, Netflix could prioritize optimizing their platform for laptop users, enhancing user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) on larger screens. For tablet and smartphone users, Netflix could implement features like better offline content options and mobile-specific recommendations. For smart TV users, Netflix could enhance TV-specific app features (e.g., better navigation, recommendations based on viewing patterns).

7.     Also, work on improving the Netflix app’s usability on smart TVs by offering enhanced features like voice control, better recommendations, and exclusive smart-TV-focused experiences. Additionally, Netflix could offer bundled plans or discounts for users who purchase compatible smart TVs to increase engagement.

8.     Create tailored content strategies that appeal to these age groups. For the 41-50 age range, focus on classic, nostalgia-driven shows, while for the younger 21-30 range, focus on trending content, high-energy series, and youth-oriented themes. Consider adjusting promotional messaging and features based on the age demographics to enhance engagement.

 

 

9.     Use this equal gender split to further personalize recommendations. Since there’s no significant skew toward one gender, content recommendations could be based on viewing habits and preferences rather than gender. However, Netflix could still consider implementing content that resonates strongly with female or male audiences when promoting exclusive content (e.g., female-centric drama or male-led action series).

10.  Implement a loyalty program for long-term subscribers to encourage retention. For example, offer rewards or points that can be redeemed for subscription discounts, merchandise, or exclusive content after reaching a certain number of months of subscription. Engage subscribers from earlier years (e.g., 2021) with re-engagement campaigns that offer incentives for staying subscribed or upgrading their plans.

11.  Implement region-specific pricing strategies to accommodate different economic conditions. For example, offer more affordable or localized pricing for countries like Spain and Canada, which could help increase subscriptions. Pricing promotions, such as holiday discounts or region-specific packages, could further boost sign-ups. Furthermore, Netflix should analyze regional payment habits to introduce local payment methods or more flexible billing options.

12.  Generally, ensure content is easily accessible in local languages for these top regions. For example, in Spain, prioritize Spanish subtitles and dubbing for international content, while in the USA and Canada, support bilingual features (e.g., English/French for Canadian subscribers). Offering a variety of language options and regional content could improve user retention and attract new subscribers.
